                    <p class="text">My interests in my specialty are quite simple. Since I like working with websites, I naturally chose what seemed to me the most fun and cool at that time - Frontend Development, but over time I began to understand how websites work in general, so I learned about the unknown and mysterious world of Backend Development, which I plan to study at this university and become stronger in this area.</p>
                    <p class="text">My interests with websites are related to the fact that since childhood it has always been easy for me both with logical subjects and with subjects that require creativity. Therefore, the world of websites has opened up all my opportunities to implement what I want to learn and create.</p>
                    <p class="text">At the moment, I am interested in studying animations (GALP) and 3D (Three.js) in websites because I see it as exciting and more professional than it may seem at first glance. I also chose React because at the time I liked it because of the community and its relative simplicity, but if I get the opportunity to study other frameworks such as Vue.js or Angular at university, I will definitely try myself in this. Also, do not forget that I really like to learn something new, so optimization, SEO, cybersecurity and design are also interesting to me, although due to my specialty I will not be able to understand this very much, but I want to understand each of the components of web development.</p>
